# RTS
Contains four files. EDD, FCFS, and SJF only run one algorithm with it being the name of the file. The last file is a combiniation of all three. It runs all three algorithms and compares the combined lateness.
It then spits out the most optimal algorithm to use based on the tasks provided. **Note, if the lateness of all three algorithms are the same FCFS will be generated as the best as it is the fastest to implement in code**
